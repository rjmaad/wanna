# Wanna Core
This is all the core functionality that powers the Wanna backend infrastructure.

## Development Setup
In order to get started with development with the `wanna_core` you have to install our package 
manager of choice: `uv`. This can be done with `pip` (hopefully the only time you have to ever 
use pip).

```
pip install uv
```

Once you have `uv` installed, you can navigate to the top level of this project and run the following:

```
uv sync
```

This will create a new local `.venv` that you should then point at for all further development work in 
the project.

## Build & Deploy
This will be docker stuff in the future, have not gotten there yet.
